# Audit decisions

Decisions taken during the 2026 audit that are not obvious from the code, with
the reasoning that produced them. Recorded so a later pass does not undo one by
mistake or rediscover it by paying for it.

## History will not be rewritten

`legacy/data/` holds nine source images totalling 44.4 MB, and adding them cost
the object store nothing: the pack stayed at 85.60 MiB and the object count at
205, because git is content-addressed and those blobs were already present from
before commit `b0778b8` removed the `JPGs/` paths. Re-adding identical bytes
under a new path creates a tree entry, not a second copy.

That saving depends entirely on the old paths remaining reachable in history. A
rewrite to purge `JPGs/` would delete the only copies the pack holds, at which
point `legacy/data/` becomes the sole copy and the same 44.4 MB has to be stored
for real. A cleanup intended to shrink the repository would grow it. There is a
second reason on the same side: rewriting changes every commit hash downstream
of the earliest edit, and a signed root commit makes that the whole history.

## The PDF is the document of record

For any question about what the thesis says, read `writeup/Duyst_Thesis.pdf`,
not `Duyst-Yale-Thesis.md`. The two are not the same document and the markdown
is the weaker source.

The markdown numbers its figures sequentially, Figure 1 through Figure 18, with
no chapter-decimal number anywhere; the PDF uses the chapter-decimal scheme the
text refers to, Figure 1.1, 3.1 and 4.1 through 4.7. So a figure number means
different things in the two files and cannot be carried between them. The
markdown also carries its own eighteen images embedded as base64 data URIs
rather than referencing the committed figures, so its pictures are not
necessarily the repository's pictures. And it has no abstract, results or
discussion section at all: it contains no heading above the third level and
none named for any of them.

A figure identification made in this audit was wrong and had to be reversed
after checking the PDF. That is the reason for the rule rather than an
illustration of it.

## Provincial_Graph.png is the published figure

`legacy/figures/Provincial_Graph.png` is the figure published as Figure 4.6.
It was confirmed by extracting the embedded image from page 21 of the PDF and
comparing: the same title, the same peach, light green and dark green palette,
the same bars, and the same legend along the bottom. It is also byte-identical
to the `Prov_Stats.png` blob `f1769763`, deleted twice in 2023, so it is the
long-lived file under a later name.

`legacy/figures/Provincial-Stats.png` is a later restyle that does not appear in
the thesis. It carries a different title, a beige, mint and teal palette, a
legend moved to the top and bars grouped by year. It is the more polished of the
two, which is presumably why it keeps being taken for the original. It was
identified incorrectly before being settled against the PDF.

## Urban figure colour is a year label, not a quantity

The three urban figures use a different thematic colour for each year: pale
green for 2000, pink for 2010, and pale blue-violet for 2018. This matches how
the thesis text describes them. The three rice figures do the opposite, using
one green across all years, and all six share the same basemap, extent and
framing.

Urban colour therefore encodes which year is being shown, not how much of
anything there is. Reading it as a thematic quantity, or comparing urban colours
across the three panels as though they were on one scale, produces nonsense.

## h5py applies no fill masking

Reading a grouped netCDF through xarray, with either the `netcdf4` or the
`h5netcdf` engine, masks the fill value to NaN by default; the two engines agree
with each other exactly. Reading the same file through h5py directly does not:
the fill cell comes back as its raw sentinel value.

This matters because the failure is silent. A mean or a sum computed over an
unmasked array is pulled toward the sentinel rather than raising, and a large
negative sentinel over a sparse granule can move a result by orders of magnitude
while still returning a plausible-looking number. Any code that drops to h5py
for speed has to mask the fill itself. The sentinel TROPOMI Level 2 actually
uses should be read from the granule's own `_FillValue` attribute rather than
assumed.
